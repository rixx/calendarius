    You'd think that grabbing a random date is easy, wouldn't you?

    First off, a qualifier: Picking a random /European/ date.
    This excludes non-European calendars, and calendar reforms
    in the colonies, because I can't be arsed to learn those.

    We're starting by picking a year and a month at random, because
    those always exist, thank fuck. Now, we can't pick a random
    day next, because the available days depend on the calendar
    in use, which, between 1582 and 1924, depends on the location.
    So we pick a location, and then we can make sure that
    a) we're not using leap days that did not exist, and b)
    that our random date did actually occur.

    I'm tempted to add a mode where "Trick question, this date did
    not occur" is a valid answer.

    Some of this is imprecise, because I can't be arsed to make
    sure countries are only included when they actually existed.
